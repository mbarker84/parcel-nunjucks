# ðŸ“¦ Punjucks

Sorry about the terrible name. I love [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org) but got sad that it doesnâ€™t support HTML templating languages other than Pug. This project uses the [nunjucks-to-html](https://github.com/AlexisPuga/nunjucks-to-html) package to convert Nunjucks files to HTML during development with Parcel. It also includes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and an SVG sprite generator, because I often need those things. Happy days ðŸ˜Ž
